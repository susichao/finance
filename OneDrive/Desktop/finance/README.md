# Analyzing and Categorizing Transactions using Local LLMs and Personal Finance Dashboard

This project utilizes Local Language Models (LLMs) to analyze and categorize financial transactions and visualize the results through an interactive personal finance dashboard. By leveraging LLMs for natural language processing, we can automatically classify transactions and offer users valuable insights into their spending habits, budgeting, and financial health.

## Features

- **Transaction Categorization**: Automatically classify financial transactions into categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, entertainment) using local LLMs.
- **Personal Finance Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard to visualize categorized transactions, budgets, spending patterns, and financial trends.
- **Local LLM Integration**: Ensures privacy and security by analyzing transactions on local machines rather than sending data to cloud-based services.
- **Data Insights**: Generate graphs, charts, and reports on spending habits, savings, and budgets.
- **Customizable Categories**: Users can manually adjust transaction categories and add new custom categories based on personal preferences.
- **Budget Tracking**: Set and track budgets for different categories and receive insights into overspending.

## Technologies Used

- **Local Language Models (LLMs)**: Used for natural language processing and transaction classification.
- **Backend**: Python, Flask, or Django for data processing.
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly for visual representation of transaction data.
